		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p><b>UniAspect is:</b>
		<p> - An Aspect-Oriented Programming framework for multiple languages.
		<p> - Implemented based on UNICOEN, and provides the unified description of an aspect for multiple languages.
		<p> - Able to deal with concerns cross-cutting over multiple languages as a single aspect.

		<h2>Usage</h2>
		<h3>Execution Environment</h3>
		<p>UniAspect and UNICOEN are developed with C#. Therefore, you need to prepare .NET framework to execute UniAspect. Visual Studio 2010 is also required when you want to build UniAspect from source code. Please install these tools if needed.
		<p>All dlls is required when you invoke UniAspect. Please confirm /bin directory when the system does not work well.

		<h3>Tutorial</h3>
		<p>This part introduces how to insert code into function execution joinpoint as the example of an aspect weaving.
		Use two files as follows in this section.
		<ul>
			<li>A target base code (Sample.java)
			<li>An Aspect program  (Logger.apt)
		</ul>
		<p>Since the specification of the directory is only allowed for specifying the target base code, store the target base code into the "basecode" directory.
		<p>The detail of two files is as below.
		
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1413134.js?file=Sample.java"></script>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1413134.js?file=Logger.apt"></script>
		
		<p>The grammer of an aspect of UniAspect is AspectJ-like format. 
		More information about an aspect description can be referenced in the paper.
		The details of the description will be available on this site at the later date.
		<p>Logger.apt shows that it inserts log code into all functions in the target program.
		In this case, only functions declared in the Java program will be targeted for the weaving because there is @Java identifier.
		The execution command is as follows.
		<pre class='terminal'>$ UniAspect basecode Logger.apt</pre>
		
		<br>
		<p>The first parameter is the path of the directory that includes all target base code.
		The second parameter is the path of the aspect file.
		The process of the aspect weaving will be performed when all paths are correct.
		And then, the result of weaving will be outputted into "output" directory.
		Note that output directory might be overwritten when there already exists "output" directory.
		<p>The result of weaving is as follows.
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1413134.js?file=SampleWithAspect.java"></script>
		
		<p>Not only Java program but also programs written in other languages can be targeted by specifying language-depend block, for example, @JavaScript, @CSharp and so on.
		<p>By the way, the program analysis phase in UniAspect is based on UNICOEN, and the maturity of parser in each languages differs.
		UNICOEN can parse complex programs in the Java and JavaScript languages; high maturity.
		But in the other languages, it cannot parses complex program; low maturity. (It can parse brief program.)
		UNICOEN project is now improving the parser so that UniAspect can deal with complex program in all corresponding languages.

		<h2>Download</h2>
		<p>Currently, UniAspect have been developed together with UNICOEN.
		<p>You can find UniAspect in the UnicoenProject, which can be downloaded form here (
			<a href="http://github.com/UnicoenProject/UNICOEN/zipball/master">zip</a> or
			<a href="http://github.com/UnicoenProject/UNICOEN/tarball/master">tar</a> formats).
		<p>You can also clone the project with <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> by running:
		<pre class='terminal'>$ git clone git://github.com/UnicoenProject/UNICOEN</pre>
